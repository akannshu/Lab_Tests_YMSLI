1. In JDBC, one needs to write code to map the object model’s data representation to the schema of the relational model.
Hibernate maps the object model’s data to the schema of the database itself with the help of annotations.

2. JDBC enables developers to create queries and update data to a relational database using the Structured Query Language (SQL).
Hibernate uses HQL (Hibernate Query Language) which is similar to SQL but understands object-oriented concepts like inheritance, association etc.

3. JDBC code needs to be written in a try catch block as it throws checked exception(SQLexception).
Whereas Hibernate manages the exceptions itself by marking them as unchecked.

4. JDBC is database dependent i.e. one needs to write different codes for different database.
Whereas Hibernate is database independent and same code can work for many databases with minor changes.

5. Creating associations between relations is quite hard in JDBC.
Associations like one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one, and many-to-many can be acquired easily with the help of annotations.

other benefits of hibernate:

Hibernate supports lazy initialization using proxy objects and perform actual database queries only when it’s required.
Hibernate cache helps us in getting better performance.
For database vendor specific feature, hibernate is suitable because we can also execute native sql queries.
