1. In this project we had to provide queries for interactiong with database. Also we have to create tables by ourselves.
 whereas Hibernate uses ORM to do such stuff.

2. JDBC is database dependent Whereas Hibernate is database independent.

3. Creating associations between relations is quite hard in JDBC associations like one-to-one etc can be used using annotations.

4. JDBC code needs to be written in a try catch block as it throws checked exception(SQLexception).
   Whereas Hibernate manages the exceptions itself by marking them as unchecked.

5. Hibernate reduces the boiler plate code
